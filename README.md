# The Visionaries 
#VITERN

 There are many ways to find internships or part time jobs but none of them are dedicated only for students , we are proposing the idea of making a dedicated website for only students that is curently exclusive for VIT students at the moment . The importance of the website is that it is place where we would have only students and the recruiters would get fresh talents directly from the students itself o Best way to find more opportunities and experience as a student o No other platform is working only for students

Key Functionalities • Main Features: Student can get internship exclusively for them only • Additional Features: • Students can join live projects from the incubation stage with support from VITTBI. • Companies can offer verified internships after institutional authentication. • Personalized dashboards for tracking applications and project participation. • AI-based recommendation engine to suggest suitable opportunities. • Any other information: • Option to include system architecture diagrams, workflow models, and mockupsfor better visualization. • Scalable design enabling expansion beyond VIT to other universities in the future
